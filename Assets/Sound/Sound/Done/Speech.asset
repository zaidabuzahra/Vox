  - 'My friends, today marks the beginning of a new era. An era where humanity no
    longer fears the collapse of our natural world '
  - but rises to meet it with innovation, with ingenuity, with hope.
  - The bioengine is more than a creation, it is a promise. A promise that we will
    endure. That even as the old world fades, we will build something greater. Together.
  - 'With its Photosynthesis Oxygen, Self-repair and its own gravity to fully evolve
    nature to capacities that were never felt possible. '
