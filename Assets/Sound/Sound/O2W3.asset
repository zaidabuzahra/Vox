  - "We\u2019ve been here so long, Alaric. Loop after loop\u2026 fixing one thing
    just to watch another fall apart. I\u2019m starting to get tired\u2026\r"
  - 'Tired of what? The system? The work?

'
  - Tired of chasing balance we never reach. Tired of the loop. Of thinking the next
    fix will make it whole again.
  - "We don\u2019t stop just because it hurts. You think Eden Strand was built overnight?
    We endured failures, setbacks. "
  - 'We built this because the world needed a new foundation.

'
  - "Failures, yes. But this feels different. Like the system wants to break, no
    matter what we do. became a maze. Every solution just opens another corridor\r"
  - "I know. But there\u2019s a kind of comfort in the routine, isn\u2019t there?
    Even the pain it\u2019s familiar. We tell ourselves: maybe the next loop will
    be different.\r"
  - 'It never is.

'
  - "No\u2026 I believe we still can. It was beautiful once, wasn\u2019t it? The
    idea that we could build something perfect\u2026something that would never collapse."
  - "Something that could carry us forward forever. We can't stop now. Not when we\u2019re
    this close.\r\n\r\n"
  - ahh then lets go one more time maybe this time we will finally understand
