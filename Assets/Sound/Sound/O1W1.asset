  - Alaric, I think the anomalies here are starved and drained by the BioEngine.
  - "Something is pulling more power than it should\u2026\r\n"
  - "Hmm\u2026 that would explain the drain. But why would the BioEngine reroute
    that much energy?"
  - " Unless\u2026 no.. never mind  we have to check the uplink console at the lab."
  - "If something\u2019s rewriting priorities or causing any issues it\u2019ll show
    up there.\r\n"
