  - Again?! Orion check the systems. Did we fix it?
  - "It seems we cleared the anomaly in Sector 3. So we did something\u2026\r\n"
  - "What about the waterfall? Did we finally extend the BioEngine\u2019s reach?\r"
  - "Strange\u2026 The roots haven\u2019t reached the waterfall. And yet it\u2019s
    alive. Thriving. Blooming like the system is working for some reason.\r\n\r"
  - "No signal\u2026 but clear results? That shouldn\u2019t be possible. Unless\u2026
    the BioEngine\u2019s effect has become indirect. Ambient, maybe.\r\n\r\n"
  - "\rWe need to investigate further.\r                                                   
    How do you propose we proceed, Orion?\r\n\n\r\n"
