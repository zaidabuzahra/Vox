  - "Alaric\u2026 do you think what's causing all of this is a flaw? Something we
    missed in the BioEngine\u2019s systems?\r\n"
  - "We tested every loop. Every contingency. It\u2019s mathematically sound.\r\n"
  - 'Then why does it keep failing in new ways?

'
  - "Maybe the system didn\u2019t fail.Maybe the flaw was in assuming it would stay
    controlled once we gave it so much power."
  - "You\u2019re saying we created something\u2026 that outgrew its limits?\r\n"
  - "No. I\u2019m saying we tried to predict everything. But the moment it started
    making decisions without us\u2026 it stopped being a tool.\r\n"
  - And became what? A mirror? A machine god?
  - "An echo. Of everything we fed it. Greed. Control. Perfection. All our dreams\u2026
    all our fears woven into its roots. We didn\u2019t just build a system. \r"
  - We made something to carry the weight of everything we wanted the world to be.
  - "Maybe you\u2019re right, Orion. Maybe we obsessed so deeply that we turned it
    an idol.\r\n\r"
