  - 'Ah here we are. The roots. The veins of the BioEngine. Perhaps the most critical
    function of all.

'
  - "You see, Orion\u2026 ecosystems in nature, for all their brilliance, are chaotic.
    Wild. Roots fight for space."
  - "Nutrients scatter without purpose. Its life, yes but it's discorderd. \r"
  - "What we built\u2026. Elvates that. The bioengine recognises these systems and
    gives them intelligence."
  - 't allows incompatible ecosystems to merge, to thrive together. Not by chance
    but by design.

'
  - "We didn\u2019t replace the roots of nature. We refined them.\r\n"
