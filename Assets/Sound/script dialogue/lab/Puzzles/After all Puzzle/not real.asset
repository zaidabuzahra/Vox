  captions:
  - 'Oh, it was real. But not natural.

    The BioEngine created an artificial
    gravity field, tailored for ideal botanical growth.'
  - 'Weightless air. Weightless life.

    Gravity  when removed allows nature to
    stretch its design. Freely. Exponentially.

'
  - "In microgravity, roots no longer dig they search. Stems don\u2019t stand they
    spiral toward synthetic light."
  - Left unchecked, photosynthesis becomes erratic. But with artificial gravity and
    light modulation, we sculpted a controlled biosphere.
  - "Plants grew ten times faster. Oxygen density increased. Ecosystems behaved\u2026
    like orchestras under a conductor.\r\n"
  - "But now, the Core is destabilizing. If it fails, the gravity field collapses.\r\n
    And when gravity goes\u2026 so does everything else.\r\n"
  - "You\u2019ll need the tool hovering before you. We called it the A.G.E. Device
    Artificial Gravitational Equalizer. But you just called it the Gravity Gun. Take
    it.\r\n"
